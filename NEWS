Change History
--------------
2020-05-01 luaotfload v3.14
    * bug fix for luaotfload-tool, luaotfload-tool --list=basename failed (texlive list)
    * fontloader patched to resolve issue #124
    
2020-05-01 luaotfload v3.13
    * A problem with text fonts with minimal math table has been fixed (issue 148.)
      In new luaotfload versions, math parameters will only be loaded for fonts with `script=math`.
      If you do want to set math parameters for fonts with other scripts, add `-nomathparam`.
      We strongly recommend against setting math parameters for text fonts because
      these would overwrite parameters from actual math fonts.
    * A bug in harf-mode that could lead to missing chars and freezing was corrected (issue 141).
    * A font size problem in harf-mode has been fixed (issue 147).
    * An error if the main function was called twice has been fixed (issue 145).
    * Allow .ttf fonts to be loaded with a map file with luahbtex (issue 142) (issue 143).
    * Fonts installed for a single user on windows are now found (issue 138).
    * A problem with wrong \TeX-ligatures in harf mode has been fixed (issue 139).
    * The debugging output has been changed (issue 131).
    * a missing U+1E9E (Capital ß) in a font is replaced by 
      SS instead of giving a missing character.
    * extended the color handling to be compatible with the luacolor package  
    * sync with context files from 2020-04-30

    * Small bug correction
    
2019-11-10 luaotfload v3.11
    * Changed the handling of the script key in harf mode to be more compatible with behaviour of the node mode.

    * rename ``luaotfload-merged.lua`` (the fontloader package from Context)
      to ``luaotfload-fontloader.lua``
    * Treat arguments of the ``letterspace`` option as percentages; add

      letterspacing is now the canonical method.
    * Merge functionality from extralibs (fake Context layer) into

    * There is now a central, non-personal dev repo on github:
      https://github.com/lualatex/luaotfload
    * Synchronisation with ConTeXt from TeXLive 2013, inducing
      backward-incompatible changes in the font structure. A
      backward-compatibility layer has been added for the current
      versions of fontspec, unicode-math and microtype, but it should
      disapear in a future version.
    * Synchronisation with ConTeXt is now easier and can be done by just
      updating luaotfload-merged.lua (<= luatex-fonts-merged.lua from
      the LuaTeX-Plain format)

    * Optional caching of name: lookups (uses separate cache file)
    * Rewriting and increased fidelity of XeTeX emulation

    * The Adobe Glyph List (font-age.lua) is now built via script (mkglyphlist)
    * Hans adapted the font loader to several of our requests (attribute
      allocation, custom merged package name etc.)
    * Auxiliary functions for package authors
    * Man page for luaotfload-tool
    * Unsupported v1.3 codebase is included in the luaotfload-*lua files. Crude,
      but effective way to support older Luatex binaries
    * implemented basic cache control/stats option for luaotfload-tool
    * Character list is generated from char-def.lua (mkcharacters)

2013/04/27, luaotfload v1.3:

    *  fixing font cache file name with non-ascii characters

2013/04/25, luaotfload v1.29:
    * Reverting the unified resolver, as the database was rebuilt too often
