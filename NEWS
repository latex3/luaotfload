    * Add ``sign`` target to makefile for automated package signing.
    * Add ``--dumpconf`` option to luaotfload-tool for generating configuration

      luaotfload-database (fontconfig) into the new file
      luaotfload-parsers.lua.
    * Move logging routines from luaotfload-override in to luaotfload-log.
    * Scan local font files (``--local`` flag to luaotfload-tool, flag
      ``scan_local`` during TeX run).
    * Add bisection mode (``--bisect``) to luaotfload-tool.

      ``aux.read_font_index()``.
    * Distinguish XDG configuration paths (Reuben Thomas)
    * Optional configuration via rc files.
    * Configure default features via configuration file.

    * Test runner (script mktests)
    * New luaotfload-tool option: ``--no-reload``
    * ``luaotfload-tool --find`` now understands request syntax
    * text (Lua script) version of the font index is filtered through gzip by
      default, the ``--no-compress`` option of luaotfload-tool will prevent
      this
    * rename ``luaotfload-merged.lua`` (the fontloader package from Context)
      to ``luaotfload-fontloader.lua``
    * Treat arguments of the ``letterspace`` option as percentages; add
      ``kernfactor`` option that behaves as before.
    * Remove imported version of typo-krn.lua. Xetex-style per-font
      letterspacing is now the canonical method.
    * Merge functionality from extralibs (fake Context layer) into
      luaotfload-letterspace.lua as it is only needed there anyways.

    * Rewrite the output of ``\fontname`` via ``patch_font`` callback
    * Allow blacklisting directories
    * Drop compatibility layer
    * Remove dependency on luaotfload-lib-dir (references to dir.glob() and

      the argument --inspect

2013/05/20, luaotfload v2.2:
    * There is now a central, non-personal dev repo on github:
      https://github.com/lualatex/luaotfload
    * Synchronisation with ConTeXt from TeXLive 2013, inducing
      backward-incompatible changes in the font structure. A
      backward-compatibility layer has been added for the current
      versions of fontspec, unicode-math and microtype, but it should
      disapear in a future version.
    * Synchronisation with ConTeXt is now easier and can be done by just
      updating luaotfload-merged.lua (<= luatex-fonts-merged.lua from
      the LuaTeX-Plain format)
    * Improved and extended documentation
    * Font filenames are stored in the database (file: lookups more efficient)
    * Optional caching of name: lookups (uses separate cache file)
    * Rewriting and increased fidelity of XeTeX emulation
    * Renaming mkluatexfontdb into luaotfload-tool (the old behavior is kept if
      the script is symlinked or renamed mkluatexfontdb)
    * Added options to luaotfload-tool for simple database queries
    * Logging facilities have been rewritten and allow for more granularity
    * All files have been renamed, abandoning cryptic acronyms; also
      the new prefix is "luaotfload" (<= "otfl")
    * The Adobe Glyph List (font-age.lua) is now built via script (mkglyphlist)
    * Hans adapted the font loader to several of our requests (attribute
      allocation, custom merged package name etc.)
    * Auxiliary functions for package authors
    * Man page for luaotfload-tool
    * Unsupported v1.3 codebase is included in the luaotfload-*lua files. Crude,
      but effective way to support older Luatex binaries
    * implemented basic cache control/stats option for luaotfload-tool
    * Character list is generated from char-def.lua (mkcharacters)

2013/04/27, luaotfload v1.3:

    *  fixing font cache file name with non-ascii characters

2013/04/25, luaotfload v1.29:
    * Reverting the unified resolver, as the database was rebuilt too often
