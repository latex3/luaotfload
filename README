*******************************************************************************
                            The Luaotfload Package
*******************************************************************************

Luaotfload is an adaptation of the ConTeXt font loading system for the Plain
and LaTeX formats. It allows OpenType fonts to be loaded with font features
accessible using an extended font request syntax while providing compatibility
with XeTeX. By indexing metadata in a database it facilitates loading fonts by
their proper names instead of file names.

Luaotfload may be loaded in Plain LuaTeX with "\input luaotfload.sty" and in
LuaLaTeX with "\usepackage{luaotfload}". LuaLaTeX users may be interested in
the fontspec package which provides a high-level interface to the functionality
provided by this package.

Please see the documentation luaotfload.pdf for more information.

This package is developed by the LuaLaTeX dev team on
<http://github.com/lualatex/luaotfload>. Please report bugs to the issue
tracker there.

The development for LuaLaTeX is discussed on the lualatex-dev mailing list. See
<http://www.tug.org/mailman/listinfo/lualatex-dev> for details.

Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here are the recommended installation methods (preferred first).

1. If you are using TeX Live 2008 or later, use 'tlmgr install luaotfload'.
   Alternatively, try your (TeX or Linux) distribution's package management
   system.

2. a. Download luaotfload.tds.zip from CTAN.
   b. Unzip it at the root of one or your TDS trees.
   c. You may need to update some filename database after, see your TeX
      distribution's manual for details.

3. a. Grab the sources from CTAN or github.
   b. Run 'make install TEXMFROOT=/path/to/texmf'.
   c. See 2c.

4. Try to figure it out by looking at the Makefile and comments in the sources.

Prerequisites
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You need GNU make to use the Makefile. The executable may be called "gmake" on
your system.

Typesetting the documentation requires LuaTeX and GraphViz. The Docutils are
needed to generate the manpage.
