Luaotfload is an adaptation of the ConTeXt font loading system for the Plain
and LaTeX formats. It allows OpenType fonts to be loaded with font features
accessible using an extended font request syntax while providing compatibility
with XeTeX. By indexing metadata in a database it facilitates loading fonts by
their proper names instead of file names.

Luaotfload may be loaded in Plain LuaTeX with `\input luaotfload.sty`. 
In LuaLaTeX it is loaded by default. LuaLaTeX users may be interested in
the fontspec package which provides a high-level interface to the functionality
provided by this package.

Please see the documentation luaotfload.pdf for more information.

## Requirements

The current luaotfload needs luatex 1.10 (present in TeXLive 2019 and a current MiKTeX). 
harfmode need luahbtex 1.11.2.
The development targets the engines luatex and luahbtex and the version
that are in TeXLive 2020. 

Other luatex versions and luatex engine variants are *not* officially supported. 

## Development versions

The main ongoing development is in the dev branch. If you clone the git and run `l3build install`
in the main folder the files will be installed in 
the latex-dev part of your TEXMFHOME or the texmf you gave as option to the command 
(see the l3build documentation for details). 
They can then be tested with [lualatex-dev](https://www.latex-project.org/news/2019/09/01/LaTeX-dev-format/).
Very experimental stuff is in the various other dev branches.  

## Pull requests

The experimental branches are normally the newest but can have a quite short life. If a pull request is made
against such a branch it gets automatically closed when the branch is closed. In general it is therefore better to make
pull requests against the dev branch.
