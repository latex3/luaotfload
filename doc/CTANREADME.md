# The Luaotfload Package

VERSION: 2.91

DATE: 2018-10-03


## Description

Luaotfload is an adaptation of the ConTeXt font loading system for the Plain
and LaTeX formats. It allows OpenType fonts to be loaded with font features
accessible using an extended font request syntax while providing compatibility
with XeTeX. By indexing metadata in a database it facilitates loading fonts by
their proper names instead of file names.

Luaotfload may be loaded in Plain LuaTeX with "\input luaotfload.sty" and in
LuaLaTeX with "\usepackage{luaotfload}". LuaLaTeX users may be interested in
the fontspec package which provides a high-level interface to the functionality
provided by this package.

Please see the documentation luaotfload.pdf for more information.
